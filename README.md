### <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/PyTorch_logo_icon.svg" height="20" /> PyTorch extensions

These repositories are small self-contained tools written in pure PyTorch, 
that I have found useful in many projects. 

They are (relatively) stable, as backward-compatible as possible with 
respect to PyTorch versions, and can be used as core dependencies to 
higher level projects.

| Package                                                        | Description | Readiness |

> The CUDA/C++ sources are compiled

### ðŸ§  Machine Learning for NeuroImaging

These packages underpin my research in medical image computing.

In general, my aim is to write a set of mid-level packages that 
specialize in various tasks (data augmentation, network architectures, 
modality-specific tasks, etc.).
