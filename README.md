### 🔥 PyTorch extensions

These repositories are small self-contained tools written in pure PyTorch, 
that I have found useful in many projects. 

They are (relatively) stable, as backward-compatible as possible with 
respect to PyTorch versions, and can be used as core dependencies to 
higher level projects.

| Package                                                        | Description | Readiness |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| [`torch-bounds`](https://github.com/balbasty/torch-bounds)     | Boundary conditions (circulant, mirror, reflect) and real transforms (DCT, DST) | 🟢 |
| [`torch-interpol`](https://github.com/balbasty/torch-interpol) | High-order spline interpolation | 🟢 |
| [`torch-distmap`](https://github.com/balbasty/torch-distmap)   | Euclidean distance transform | 🟢 |
| [`torch-relay`](https://github.com/balbasty/torch-relay)       | Backward-compatible PyTorch functions (work-in-progress) | 🔴 |
| [`torch-diffeo`](https://github.com/balbasty/torch-diffeo)     | Scaling-and-squaring and Geodesic Shooting layers in PyTorch (work-in-progress) | 🟠 |
| [`jitfields`](https://github.com/balbasty/jitfields)           | Fast functions for dense scalar and vector fields, implemented using just-in-time compilation | 🟠 |

> [!NOTE]
> The last package, `jitfields`, reimplements many of the utilities from the other core
> packages, but does it directly in CUDA/C++.
>
> The CUDA/C++ sources are compiled 
> just-in-time using [`cupy`](https://github.com/cupy/cupy) 
> and [`cppyy`](https://github.com/wlav/cppyy).

### 🧠 Machine Learning for NeuroImaging

These packages underpin my research in medical image computing.

In general, my aim is to write a set of mid-level packages that 
specialize in various tasks (data augmentation, network architectures, 
modality-specific tasks, etc.).
